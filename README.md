## Lab Location 
Harvard Science Center room 115 

## Overview 
This is a hands-on lab course intended to complement the Physics E-1ax lecture course. 
You will meet in Science Center room 115 roughly every other week to complete a total of six laboratory experiments (see “Lab Section Schedule” below for specific dates). These experiments include aspects of measurement and uncertainty, force and momentum, elasticity and oscillation, fluid dynamics, and statistical mechanics. Collaborating with your classmates and guided by the teaching staff, you will develop practical skills in data collection and analysis. 

## Prerequisites 
Concurrent enrollment in PHYS E-1ax, or prior completion of a comparable course in physics (mechanics) is assumed. 
We expect you to have familiarity with algebra, trigonometry, and exponential functions; MATH E-10 or equivalent work in precalculus is highly recommended. 

## Attendance and Participation Policy 
We expect you to attend each of your assigned lab sections. If you miss a lab without an excused absence you will receive zero credit for the experiment. See the “Missed Lab Sections, and Cancellations” section below for more information on what to do if you must be absent from your assigned section meeting. 

Students must arrive on time for their lab—you may not receive full credit for the experiment if you are late! 

Active participation in all aspects of the experiment—including data collection and analysis—is necessary for you to succeed in the course. You will work in groups of two when possible (three students at a maximum). All data, graphs, calculations, answers to questions, and conclusions are a collaborative effort of the group, and each group member is assigned the same grade for the submitted work (see “Lab Grading Procedure” section below for more details on grading criteria). 

## Pre-lab assignments
There will be a pre-lab assignment for each lab that must be completed before your lab starts. These assignments are designed to prepare you for lab in a way that is low-stakes and low-stress. The assignment will be in Canvas as a series of "quizzes," but you have multiple attempts to get all the points in each quiz.

## Lab Handouts and Materials 
There is no textbook for the course. All equipment for your experiment will be supplied in your lab section, and any documents you need will be provided online. 

## Lab Notebook Submission 
Before the end of the lab session, you and each member of your lab group will submit a copy of your electronic lab notebook to the course website. Please notify the teaching staff immediately if you are having technical difficulties with the course website. Time permitting, we encourage you to have your TA look over the work to offer suggestions for improvement before it is uploaded. 

## Lab Grading Procedure 

Each lab report is graded as a group on a scale of 0-5. The grading is based on the following rubric:  
### 5 
The group clearly understands the relevant physics concepts in the experiment. All tables, plots, photos, and calculations are clearly labeled and easy to read, and all questions in the lab handout are answered. An appropriate effort has been made to account for experimental uncertainties in all measurements and calculations. All members of the group participated equally in the collection and analysis of the experiment data. Minor mistakes and careless errors can appear, insofar as they do not indicate a conceptual misunderstanding. 
### 4 
The group seems to understand the main physics concepts and problem-solving techniques, but has some minor yet non-trivial gaps in their reasoning. A question or instruction from the lab handout may have been overlooked. Presentation of the data lacks a little in neatness and organization. Accounting for experimental uncertainty has been inconsistently or inappropriately applied. Participation in the experiment was unequal among the group members. 
### 3 
The group has partially understood the experiment. Reasoning and problem-solving techniques are either incomplete or inappropriate. A question or instruction from the lab handout may have been ignored, or otherwise left incomplete. Data, plots, or photos may be difficult to read and understand. Experimental uncertainty has been ignored in calculations. Participation unnoticeable for one or more group members, possibly as a result of tardiness. 
### 2 
The group has a poor understanding of the experiment, the physics behind it, or the analysis. They may have gone in a not-entirely-wrong but unproductive direction, or attempted to solve the problem using pattern matching. Multiple questions or instructions have been left incomplete. Experiment data is missing.  
### 1
The group clearly did not understand the experiment. They may have written some appropriate formulas or diagrams, but nothing further. Or, they may have done something entirely wrong.  
### 0 
The group wrote nothing or almost nothing. _Note: Individual students will receive a zero for a lab experiment if they miss the lab without an excused absence._

## Course Letter Grade 
Each student begins the semester with 12 points. Points are deducted in the following way:
- Labs that receive a score of 4 or 5 will not reduce this number. 
- Labs that receive a 3 will reduce the grade by 1 point. 
- Labs that receive a 2 reduce the grade by 2 points. 
- Labs that receive a 0 or 1 reduce the grade by 3 points. 
- Each missed pre-lab activity reduces the grade by 1 point.

At the end of the term, the course letter grade is determined by the following scheme: 
A = 12 points, A– =11 points, B+ =10 points, B = 9 points, B– = 8 points, C+ = 7 points, C = 6 points, C– = 5 points, D+ = 4 points, D = 3 points, D– = 2 points, and F = 0 or 1 points. 

## Missed Lab Sections, and Cancellations 
If you cannot attend your regular section due to illness or other emergency, then you will need to contact the course head (Anna Klales) as soon as the conflict arises. You must have written (email) approval from the course head with a specific time and date for a make-up before attending a lab other than your assigned section. _All appeals to make-up a lab are at the discretion of the course head._

If possible, your make-up will be scheduled during the same week as the missed lab at one of the other sections - see [Lab Section Schedules](#Lab-Section-Schedules). If a Thursday section is not feasible, then your make-up lab may need to be scheduled during the final week of class. 

Inclement weather or other extraordinary events may cause the Extension School to cancel your lab section, and we have reserved an additional lab date for each section just in case. See the lab schedules below. 

## Academic Integrity 
In this course, lab partners are expected to work together on experiments. Submitted data, calculations, answers to questions, and conclusions are a collaborative effort by lab partners. Each member of the group will sign off on the submitted work.

You are responsible for understanding [Harvard Extension School policies on academic integrity](www.extension.harvard.edu/resources-policies/student-conduct/academic- integrity) and how to use sources responsibly. Not knowing the rules, misunderstanding the rules, running out of time, submitting "the wrong draft", or being overwhelmed with multiple demands are not acceptable excuses. There are no excuses for failure to uphold academic integrity. To support your learning about academic citation rules, please visit the [Harvard Extension School Tips to Avoid Plagiarism](www.extension.harvard.edu/resources-policies/resources/tips-avoid-plagiarism), where you'll find links to the Harvard Guide to Using Sources and two, free, online 15-minute tutorials to test your knowledge of academic citation policy. The tutorials are anonymous open-learning tools. 

## Accommodations
Students needing academic adjustments or accommodations because of a documented disability must contact the [Extension School Accessibility Services Office](https://www.extension.harvard.edu/resources-policies/accessibility-student-services) and submit the [Request for Accommodation Form](https://www.extension.harvard.edu/sites/extension.harvard.edu/files/atoms/files/request_ for_accommodation_form.pdf) and appropriate documentation no later than two weeks before the course begins (in other words, no later than August 16, 2019). Failure to do so may result in the course head’s inability to respond in a timely manner. All discussions will remain confidential, although the course head is invited to contact the Accessibility Services Office to discuss appropriate implementation.
