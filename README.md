## Overview 
This is a hands-on lab course intended to complement the Physics E-1ax lecture course. 
You will meet in Science Center room 115 roughly every other week to complete a total of six laboratory experiments (see [Schedules](#Lab-Section-Schedules) for specific dates). These experiments include aspects of measurement and uncertainty, force and momentum, elasticity and oscillation, fluid dynamics, and statistical mechanics. Collaborating with your classmates and guided by the teaching staff, you will develop practical skills in data collection and analysis. 

## Learning Objectives
This course will help you understand how we _know_ what we know. While the lab deals with some concepts covered in the lecture course, the main objective of the course is to teach you how to use data to figure out something new and convince someone else that you have. The skills you learn in this course will help you evaluate an experiment, understand the limitations of a measurement, and think critically about information. These skills are applicable far outside of physics, and we hope you have some fun learning them!

## Prerequisites 
Concurrent enrollment in PHYS E-1ax, or prior completion of a comparable course in physics (mechanics) is assumed. 
We expect you to have familiarity with algebra, trigonometry, and exponential functions; MATH E-10 or equivalent work in precalculus is highly recommended. 

## Attendance and Participation Policy 
**We expect you to attend each of your assigned lab sections.** If you miss a lab without an excused absence you will receive zero credit for the experiment. See [Missed Lab Sections and Cancellations](#Missed-Lab-Sections-and-Cancellations) for more information on what to do if you must miss your assigned section meeting. 

Students must arrive **on time** for lab — you may not receive full credit for the experiment if you are late! 

**Active participation** in all aspects of the experiment—including data collection and analysis—is necessary for you to succeed in the course. You will work in groups of two when possible (three students at a maximum). All data, plots, calculations, answers to questions, and conclusions are a collaborative effort of the group. Each group member is assigned the same grade for the submitted work (see [Grading](#Grading) for details). You should also engage your lab instructors during the lab; you are learning during lab time, so we don't expect you to be able to do everything on your own without asking questions.

## Pre-lab assignments
There will be a pre-lab assignment for each lab that must be completed before your lab starts. These assignments are designed to prepare you for lab in a way that is low-stakes and low-stress. The assignment will be in Canvas as a series of "quizzes," but you have multiple attempts to get all the points in each quiz. The assignments will be posted no later than 3 days before your assigned lab section.

## Course Materials 
There is no textbook for the course. All equipment for your experiment will be supplied in your lab section, and any documents you need will be provided online. You will need a gmail account (a g.harvard.edu account is perfect) to access the Colab notebooks we'll use during lab time.

## Lab Notebook Submission 
Before the end of the lab session, you and each member of your lab group will submit a copy of your electronic lab notebook to the course website. Please notify the teaching staff immediately if you encounter technical difficulties. Time permitting, we encourage you to have your TA look over your work to offer suggestions for improvement before it is uploaded. 

## Grading 

Each lab report is graded as a group on a scale of 0-5. The grading is based on the following rubric:  
### 5 
The group clearly understands the relevant physics concepts in the experiment. All tables, plots, photos, and calculations are clearly labeled and easy to read, and all questions in the lab handout are answered. An appropriate effort has been made to account for experimental uncertainties in all measurements and calculations. All members of the group participated equally in the collection and analysis of the experiment data. Minor mistakes and careless errors can appear, insofar as they do not indicate a conceptual misunderstanding. 
### 4 
The group seems to understand the main physics concepts and problem-solving techniques, but has some minor yet non-trivial gaps in their reasoning. A question or instruction from the lab handout may have been overlooked. Presentation of the data lacks a little in neatness and organization. Accounting for experimental uncertainty has been inconsistently or inappropriately applied. Participation in the experiment was unequal among the group members. 
### 3 
The group has partially understood the experiment. Reasoning and problem-solving techniques are either incomplete or inappropriate. A question or instruction from the lab handout may have been ignored, or otherwise left incomplete. Data, plots, or photos may be difficult to read and understand. Experimental uncertainty has been ignored in calculations. Participation unnoticeable for one or more group members, possibly as a result of tardiness. 
### 2 
The group has a poor understanding of the experiment, the physics behind it, or the analysis. They may have gone in a not-entirely-wrong but unproductive direction, or attempted to solve the problem using pattern matching. Multiple questions or instructions have been left incomplete. Experiment data is missing.  
### 1
The group clearly did not understand the experiment. They may have written some appropriate formulas or diagrams, but nothing further. Or, they may have done something entirely wrong.  
### 0 
The group wrote nothing or almost nothing. _Note: Individual students will receive a zero for a lab experiment if they miss the lab without an excused absence._


Each student begins the semester with 12 points. Points are deducted in the following way:
- Labs that receive a score of 4 or 5 will not reduce this number. 
- Labs that receive a 3 will reduce the grade by 1 point. 
- Labs that receive a 2 reduce the grade by 2 points. 
- Labs that receive a 0 or 1 reduce the grade by 3 points. 
- Each missed pre-lab activity reduces the grade by 1 point.

At the end of the term, the course letter grade is determined by the following scheme: 
A = 12 points, A– =11 points, B+ =10 points, B = 9 points, B– = 8 points, C+ = 7 points, C = 6 points, C– = 5 points, D+ = 4 points, D = 3 points, D– = 2 points, and F = 0 or 1 points. 

## Missed Lab Sections and Cancellations 
If you cannot attend your regular section due to illness or other emergency, you must contact the course head (Anna Klales) as soon as the conflict arises. You must have written (email) approval from the course head with a specific time and date for a make-up before attending a lab other than your assigned section. _All appeals to make-up a lab are at the discretion of the course head._

If possible, your make-up will be scheduled during the same week as the missed lab at one of the other sections - see [Lab Section Schedules](#Lab-Section-Schedules). If this is not feasible, then your make-up lab may need to be scheduled during the final week of class. 

Inclement weather or other extraordinary events may cause the Extension School to cancel your lab section, and we have reserved an additional lab date for each section just in case. See the [Lab Section Schedules](#Lab-Section-Schedules). 

## Academic Integrity 
You are responsible for understanding Harvard Extension School policies on academic integrity and how to use sources responsibly. Violations of academic integrity are taken very seriously. Review important information on academic integrity and student responsibilities [here](https://extension.harvard.edu/for-students/student-policies-conduct/academic-integrity); for more on academic citation rules, visit [Using Sources Effectively and Responsibly](https://extension.harvard.edu/for-students/support-and-services/using-sources-effectively-and-responsibly) and review the [Harvard Guide to Using Sources]( https://usingsources.fas.harvard.edu).


## Accessibility Services
The Division of Continuing Education (DCE) is committed to providing an accessible academic community. The Accessibility Services Office (ASO) is responsible for providing accommodations to students with disabilities. Students must request accommodations or adjustments through the ASO. Instructors cannot grant accommodation requests without prior ASO approval. It is imperative to be in touch with the ASO as soon as possible to avoid delays in the provision of accommodation. 

DCE takes student privacy seriously. Any medical documentation should be provided directly to the ASO if a substantial accommodation is required. If you miss class due to a short-term illness, notify your instructor and/or TA but do not include a doctor's note. Course staff will not request, accept, or review doctor's notes or other medical documentation. Please visit the [ASO website](https://www.extension.harvard.edu/resources-policies/accessibility-services-office-aso) for more information, or contact accessibility@extension.harvard.edu.
